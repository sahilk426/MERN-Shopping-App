## Install

```console
$ npm install -g dnv
```

## Description

DNV works behind the scenes to keep dependencies in your Docker container in-sync with your local project.

It also comes with a custom made, featureful ncurses-like UI designed
for use when developing apps using Docker Compose.

                                 This will update project configuration based on changes to Docker files, as well as re-generate docker-compose-dnv-gen.yml
```

### Stop

```console
Usage: dnv stop [options]

Run docker-compose stop for current directory project
```

(Useful when the 'External Volume' option is set during project initialization)

## DNV Init

### Behavior with existing Dockerfile / docker-compose.yml files

-   If **both** a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml are present, DNV will refer to those files when initializing the project.
-   If **neither** file is present, DNV will generate a basic Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
-   If **only one** of either Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml is present, initialization will error out

### Initialization options / prompts

#### Package Manager

```console
? Package Manager (Use arrow keys)
❯ npm (default)
  yarn
  yarn 2
```

#### External Volume

```console
? Do you want DNV to manage project dependencies in an external volume? (Y/n)
```

(See: [External Volume option](#external-volume))

#### Working Directory

```console
? Working directory (WORKDIR) (/usr/src/app)
```

#### Dockerfile Node Image

```console
? Dockerfile Node Image (Use arrow keys)
❯ node:16.5 (default)
  ──────────────
  node:16.5 (default)
  node:15.5
```

#### Use Node User

```console
? Use Node User (instead of root)? (y/N)
```

#### Restart containers option

```console
? Restart containers when source files change? Select services:
❯◯ service1
```

(See: [Restarting containers option](#restarting-containers-option))

#### Metrics display option (w/ External Volume option)

```console
? Enable metrics display for Node services in DNV UI. Select services:
❯◯ service1
```

#### Use alternate node image when DNV starts service (w/ External Volume option)

```console
? Use alternate image for DNV-started Node Services? (y/N)
```

### External Volume option

If you choose 'yes' for the `External Volume` option during project initialization, DNV will do the following:

-   Creates and manages an external volume containing the contents of `node_modules` / `.yarn`
-   Monitors your project's lock files for changes and re-runs npm/yarn install in Docker containers when necessary
-   Mounts your local dependency cache directory (yarn or NPM) during installation, for quick install of dependencies in Containers.
-   Force installs dependencies that require `node-gyp`, if necessary (additional dependencies can be added in the project config)
-   Generates a separate .yml file which is used when running `dnv ui` or `dnv up` (docker-compose-dnv-gen.yml)

#### What does this mean?

Primarily, it means it's not necessary to build container images for your Node services. Instead, the container file system will just be the base Node image, the contents of your project directory (bind mounted), plus the dependency directory (mounted as an external volume over the bind mount). Consequently, changing dependencies for your project doesn't require rebuilding an image (re-downloading ALL dependencies), so that's quick and painless.

#### How does DNV work if I don't use the external volume option?

DNV monitors lock files for changes and selectively rebuilds container images, if needed, when running `dnv ui` or `dnv up`

#### Should I use this?

If you're just starting development and don't have your Node dependencies nailed down yet, absolutely. It will make developing with Docker Compose much more pleasant. Otherwise, you probably won't get much benefit from it.

Note that the 'Metrics display' option is only available with the External Volume option enabled.

Also, when using the external volume option you should use `dnv stop` to stop a docker compose project originally started with `dnv ui` / `dnv up`, rather than through the Docker Desktop UI (since it doesn't remember that the project was started with a unique .yml file)

#### What is this 'docker-compose-dnv-gen.yml' file?

DNV generates a separate .yml file to use with docker-compose up when you're utilizing the external volume option. This simply copies your docker-compose.yml and adds in the necessary parts to define the external volume. Note that this is re-generated (when needed) from scratch every time changes are detected, so any modifications you make in docker-compose-dnv-gen.yml will be lost (the --nosync flag bypasses this, for testing purposes). In other words, edit your `docker-compose.yml` as usual, and those changes will get transferred to `docker-compose-dnv-gen.yml` the next time you run `dnv ui` / `dnv up`.

#### What if I need to install linux dependencies?

The recommended solution is to specify a numbered-version Node image to use with DNV, like `node:16.5` (You can set this with the 'Use alternate node image when DNV starts service' if you're using an alpine image in your Dockerfile). Hopefully this covers most cases where you would need to install extra dependencies in the container (like you often need to do if you're using an alpine image).

If that doesn't cover you, you can create a custom Node image with those dependencies installed and select it for the 'Use alternate node image when DNV starts service' option. Alternately, just don't use the External Volume option.

### Restarting containers option

If you choose 'yes' for `Restart containers when source files change?`, then DNV will...do exactly that: Restart containers when your project's source files change. If you're already using something like `nodemon` for your project then you should \***\*not\*\*** use this feature.

#### restart

Restarts the container

### Notes

`dnv ui` and `dnv up` will stop containers on exit if it is responsible for starting ALL containers for a project (they weren't already running). Otherwise, it doesn't stop any project-associated container.

## Tutorial

Here's a simple project you can make to test DNV:

1. First, pull a number-versioned Node image for docker (i.e. `docker pull node:16.5`)
2. Create a new folder and run `npm init`
3. Run `npm install express`
4. Create an index.js file with the following contents:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.listen(80, () => {
    console.log('Express listening');
});
```

5. Add a 'start' entry to 'scripts' in the package.json file:

```json
 "start": "node index.js"
```

6. Run `dnv init` and pick the default values for the provided prompts, except for the 'Metrics' and 'Restart containers' prompts, where you'll need to press `space` to select a service and then `Enter`
7. Run `dnv ui`

## DNV?!

DNV stands for `Docker Node Volume`. Originally, the CLI program just created the external volume containing node_modules and ran `docker-compose up`. It does way more now, but I stuck with the original name.

## Running DNV on Windows with WSL

The ideal setup to run DNV on Windows employs the following:

-   [Docker Desktop](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows) (required, obviously)
-   [Windows Terminal Preview](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n8g5rfz9xk3#activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
-   [Windows Subsystem for Linux v2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
-   Working in the Linux directory-space, not the mounted Windows directory

Regarding the last point, Yarn/NPM/Node are EXTREMELY SLOW if your project is in the mounted Windows directory (/mnt/c/...).

The sticking point in this setup is that if Docker Desktop is running in Administrator mode, it means the WSL2 distribution you're using must also be running in Admin to see docker, which in turn means Windows Terminal Preview must be in Admin mode to run the WSL2 distribution.

> **(Note that all this headache can be avoided by adding your User Account to the docker-users group. See item #5** [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#wsl-2-backend))

### Step 1 - Running WSL as Admin

-   Open PowerShell
-   Navigate to the directory where you want to download the distro installation (.appx) file, and run the following command

```console
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://aka.ms/wsl-debian-gnulinux -OutFile Debian.appx -UseBasicParsing
```

-   If you get an error, try renewing DNS by running the following commands in order
    -   ipconfig /release
    -   ipconfig /flushdns
    -   ipconfig /renew
-   In the download directory, change `Debian.appx` to `Debian.zip`, and extract the archive to a folder.
-   In the folder with the extracted archive contents, change `DistroLauncher-Appx_1.3.0.0_x64.appx` to `DistroLauncher-Appx_1.3.0.0_x64.zip`, and extract the archive.
-   Copy the contents of the newly-created folder to C:\debian (or wherever you want the distro executable to reside)
-   Open C:\debian, right-click on debian.exe, choose 'Run as administrator' and follow the installation prompts.

### Step 2 - Install [gsudo](https://github.com/gerardog/gsudo)

-   Open PowerShell
-   Run the following command

```console
PowerShell -Command "Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -scope Process; iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gerardog/gsudo/master/installgsudo.ps1 | iex"
```

### Step 3 - Install Windows Terminal Preview and create a profile to run the WSL as Admin

-   Install Windows Terminal Preview [from the Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n8g5rfz9xk3#activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
-   Open Windows Terminal Preview, then open Settings
-   In the left side-bar menu, scroll down and click `Add a new profile`
-   Name this profile whatever you like ("Debian Admin" or some-such). In the Command line text area, paste the following

```console
%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe gsudo wsl -d Debian
```

### Step 4 (optional) - Modify .bashrc to navigate to Linux home directory on startup

By default, WSL will open to a directory like `/mnt/c/WINDOWS/system32`, which is inconvenient. The following steps will alter .bashrc so your HOME directory is opened on startup, instead.

-   In Windows Terminal Preview, start a command line using the profile you just created and do the following commands:
    -   `sudo apt update`
    -   `sudo apt install nano`
    -   `cd ~`
    -   `nano .bashrc`
-   In the nano editor, scroll to the very bottom of the .bashrc file and add the following line:
    -   `cd ~`
-   Press `Ctrl + O` and then `Enter` to save, and then `Ctrl + X` to quit.

Also, be sure to take a look at [NodeJS on WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-wsl).

## Thanks

I'm indebted to the work done on the Blessed Terminal widget by [RSE - Blessed Xterm](https://github.com/rse/blessed-xterm) and [astefanutti - Kubebox](https://github.com/astefanutti/kubebox).

The updates to Blessed color-handling make use of code from [robey - antsy](https://github.com/robey/antsy), the [XTerm](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js) source, and [VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode). The VSCode source is a **great** resource.

The 'metrics' display for the UI is based on code from [FormidableLabs - nodejs-dashboard](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/nodejs-dashboard)

Additional box borders are from [cancerberoSgx - flor](https://github.com/cancerberoSgx/flor)

[cancerberoSgx - cli-driver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli-driver) is used in the integration tests and is **awesome**.

I think DNV has 10 dependencies created by [sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus). Maybe more. Thank you.

Of course, the underlying tech that drives the extensively modified Blessed Terminal widget used by the DNV UI is [XTerm](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js), which is amazing, in my opinion. Displaying
multiple logs with 1000+ line scrollback performantly simply wasn't feasible with the Log widget that comes with Blessed.
