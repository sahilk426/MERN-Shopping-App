# TODO

-   If you look in yonder [../src/lib/ui/blessed/patched](https://github.com/moofoo/dnv/tree/main/src/lib/ui/blessed/patched) directory you'll see the extensive mods done to Blessed. Lots of monkey-patching. Not ideal, obviously. My thinking (partly reasonable, partly laziness) is that the monkey-patching was acceptable for the purpose of getting DNV out the door and published, and that at a later date I would pull out the more general changes and do a fork of neo-blessed, including a reasonably stripped-down version of the Terminal widget DNV UI is using. That's the goal at least.

-   Going along with the above: there's a great deal of code cleanup that needs to be done, but a significant chunk of that (in the UI code) would be pointless to do now, if I just ended up moving a bunch of the code to a Blessed fork. So, that should take priority.

-   Is the preuninstall script **_actually_** running?

-   The 'grid' widget is...bad. It's fine for displaying the 2x2 Terminal panels, I guess. I'd like to implement something using Yoga or Apple's autolayout. Should be part of a potential Blessed fork, probably.

-   DNV init functionality that detected package.json files in sub-directories and led the user through prompts to setup 'multi-package' projects (where each directory = separate Node service in the compose .yml file) was commented out. Useful for developing microservices (for example). There are some decisions to be made / issues:

    -   Is this really a needed feature? (The 'feature', more specifically, being DNV generating the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml).
    -   Such a setup. with a pre-existing Dockerfile / docker-compose.yml, **should** still work, absent those prompts. Need to verify this.

-   yarn 3.0 support

-   So, grid layout is apparently wonky when there's more than one page of services (4 per page). Getting tired of plugging leaky holes with the grid widget, thinking of implementing an autolayout-based thing.

-   In the config, you can configure it so dependencies / dev dependencies are loaded in the REPL session on startup. For whatever reason, loading express doesn't work, while other packages do???
